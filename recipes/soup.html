                <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>

                <li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano</li>
                <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 small zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/2 inch slices</li>
                <li>½ cup frozen cut green beans</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>½ cup ditalini pasta</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste (Optional)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken to pot, and sauté just until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken from pot; set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the pot; add onions and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrots and celery; cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in chicken stock, diced tomatoes, cannellini beans, kidney beans, tomato paste, zucchini, green beans, Italian seasoning. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in chicken and ditalini pasta, and cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. If soup is too thick, add a little water or stock. Garnish each bowl with Parmesan and parsley.</li>
            </ol>
